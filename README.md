# proof-of-exploit-huff-template

Write PoCs for exploits in Huff and prove them in zk.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

The following will need to be installed in order to use this template. Please follow the links and instructions.

-   [Huff Compiler](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/)
    -   You'll know you've done it right if you can run `huffc --version` and get an output like: `huffc 0.3.0`
-   [Proof of Exploit](https://github.com/zemse/zk-proof-of-evm-challenge)
    -   You'll need to use this to test, prove or verify exploits.

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies using `forge install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` and then write alchemy key.
4. To test the exploit `exploit test` (reads the .env file and uses it to fill in the required cli params)

### Proving

The `exploit` binary has a subcommand `prove`:

```
$ exploit prove --help

Usage: exploit prove [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --rpc <URL>                 Enter ethereum archive node RPC url (required)
      --block <NUMBER>            Enter the fork block number (required)
      --challenge <CONTRACT>      Enter solidity file path (default: src/Challenge.sol)
      --exploit <CONTRACT>        Enter huff file path (default: src/Exploit.huff)
      --tx <HEX>                  Enter the raw tx (optional)
      --dir <PATH>                Enter the dir for srs params (optional)
      --mock                      Use mock prover (default: false)
  -h, --help                      Print help
```

- This creates an anvil mainnet fork using archive rpc node and block number provided, the rpc and block can also be read from `.env`.
- The challenge contract is hooked to the `0xfeedc0de00000000000000000000000000000000` magic address and it's codehash is included in the snark's public inputs and the source code included in proof.json.
- The exploit contract is hooked to the `0xbada550000000000000000000000000000000000` magic address and your badass code is kept secret.
- On running `exploit prove`, a local block is generated, which has just one tx sent to Challenge.entryPoint(). Using the zkEVM circuits, a proof is generated for validity of the EVM operations.

### Testing

`forge test` can be used. For testing with `exploit` binary (which uses anvil + some patches) but without generating proof:

```
$ exploit test --rpc https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<alchemy-key> --block 4774970

anvil initialized - chain_id: 11155111, block_number: 4774970
transaction gas: 97945
test passed
```

If a `.env` file is present with `ETH_RPC_URL` and `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER` then:

```
$ exploit test

anvil initialized - chain_id: 11155111, block_number: 4774970
transaction gas: 97945
test passed
```
